Description: Massive and Integrative Gene Set Analysis.
    The MIGSA package allows to perform a massive and integrative gene set 
    analysis over several expression and gene sets simultaneously. It provides 
    a common gene expression analytic framework that grants a comprehensive 
    and coherent analysis. Only a minimal user parameter setting is required 
    to perform both singular and gene set enrichment analyses in an 
    integrative manner by means of the best available methods, i.e. dEnricher 
    and mGSZrespectively.
    The greatest strengths of this big omics data tool are the availability of 
    several functions to explore, analyze and visualize its results in order 
    to facilitate the data mining task over huge information sources.
    MIGSA package also provides several functions that allow to easily load 
    the most updated gene sets from several repositories.
